# what is unit testing? #
Unit testing is a type of software testing that focuses on individual units or components of a software system. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that each unit of the software works as intended and meets the requirements. Unit testing is typically performed by developers, and it is performed early in the development process before the code is integrated and tested as a whole system.
